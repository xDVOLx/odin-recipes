        <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
        <p class="description-text">If you're like me, you struggle to find the energy to do much of anything in the
            mornings, much less prepare a healthy breakfast. <strong>Overnight oats</strong> are a perfect solution to
            ensure you have that energy you need for the day just waiting for you in the fridge. While I prefer the
            taste of peanut butter and banana, overnight oats are very versatile and can be customized however you like
            it! As written, this recipe makes 1 serving of Overnight Oats.</p>
