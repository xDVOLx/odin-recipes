# odin-recipes
A simple website to contain a collection of recipes. Nothing fancy, just a project for practicing basic HTML before moving on to learning basic CSS.
This project will demonstrate the ability to use bold text, italic text, relative links, absolute links, and images in HTML, as well as the ability to construct a basic HTML boilerplate and to commit changes to github.
